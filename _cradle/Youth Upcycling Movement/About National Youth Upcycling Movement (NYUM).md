The theme for this year’s challenge is “**Food Packaging: Don't Throw it. Upcycle it!**”

 Through this Challenge, we hope to achieve the following objectives:<br>

**Preparation Stage**
*   Schools are to plan for a one-hour time slot to go through the package in their own school (e.g. the lesson package may be carried out as a Post-Midyear/Year-End Exam Activity).

*   Schools will access the lesson package on a webpage and go through the lesson package beforehand. Schools will conduct the one-hour lesson package on their own. There will be materials for dissemination which schools may choose to print or distribute digitally.

*   During the Symposium, teams will attend a seminar featuring pertinent environmental issues and content presented by experts and consultants in the environmental conservation field.
*   A briefing cum Q & A session on the Movement will be included.
*   The Symposium will be followed on the same day by training sessions to equip teams with the knowledge and skills pertaining to the design of upcycled products.

**Presentation-cum-Consultation on Advocacy Toolkit & Outreach Project Pla**
*   After attending the NYUM Online Symposium, all teams will be required to start working on the following deliverables for the Movement:
*   * Upcycled products
*   * Advocacy outreach plans
*   All teams will be required to record the amount of different food packaging (e.g. styrofoam boxes, plastic bottles, etc) conserved by the team in their Final Report.
*   Each team will be scheduled for an online Presentation-cum-Consultation session to meet the experts and consultants in the field for feedback and comments on their upcycled products and advocacy plans, for further refinements to be made by the teams. Teams will be notified about their allocated slots for the session via email in due course.
*   All teams must prepare **at least** one upcycled product for the Presentation-cum-Consultation session. **Five** pictures from multiple angles of the upcycled prototype would be needed for presentation at the session.
*   Subsequent consultations and clarifications with the experts and consultants will be conducted via email.
