**Resources provided:** The SLS Package will be shared with schools to be assigned to students' for SDL.

**Deliverables:** Students will be required to prepare a Keynote presentation for submission in SLS. The Teacher Coding Champion will work together with students, to nominate the top idea for showcase in Term 3.

*   The SLS package with various activities and resources will be shared with the Teacher Coding Champion during pre-event webinars. Thereafter, the lesson materials will be shared with the participating teams.
*   Over 2 months, participating students are expected to complete the activities in SLS on inclusive App design, within 2.5 hours each month, to learn about basic app design principles and how to design with the users' needs in mind.

*   Students will come up with an app idea connected to a topic they care about, then discover how to design with inclusion and accessibility as a centerpiece of their app design.

*   Students will be required to prepare a Keynote presentation for submission in SLS. Templates for the Keynote presentation will be provided to schools to guide students to prepare for the submission.

*   Teachers are encouraged to guide their students while leveraging on the lesson guides and videos on the SLS.

*   At the end of Phase 1, each participating school will nominate a top idea for a celebration event at Crescent Girls’ School showcasing these app ideas.

Kickstart school holidays with Everyone Can Code virtual workshops using activities from Apple’s Quick Start to Code guide.

**Objective:** To equip students with basic coding skills through fun activities using Swift Playgrounds. Students will learn how to personalize an app in Swift Playgrounds using the About me Playgrounds that celebrates a place or tradition that is important to them.

**Resources provided:** Virtual workshops, videos and supporting content will be shared through SLS.

Deliverable: Complete activities in SLS package and a finished About Me app in Swift Playgrounds.

*   During the June holidays, students will spend 5 hours learning basic coding skills with fun activities using Swift Playgrounds. Students would finish the bootcamp with a completed app that celebrates a place or tradition that is important to them.

*   Lesson guides and videos will be made available on SLS for teachers and students to access.

*   After the bootcamp, Crescent Girls’ School will host a graduation event for all participating students.

Participating students will be presented e-certificates for completing Phase 1 and Phase 2. For more details on the program, click here to find out more.
