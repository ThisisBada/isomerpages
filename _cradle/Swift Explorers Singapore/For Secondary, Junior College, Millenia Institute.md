Great apps start with great ideas.

**Objective:** To learn about basic app design principles as well as how to design with different users' accessibility needs in mind in a teams of up to 5 students through completing the activities in SLS.

**Resources provided:** The SLS Package will be shared with schools for students' Self-directed Learning (SDL).

**Deliverables:** Students will be required to prepare a keynote presentation for submission in SLS. The Teacher Coding Champion will work together with students to nominate the top idea for showcase in Term 3.

*   Over 2 months, participating students are expected to complete the activities in SLS on inclusive App design, within 2.5 hours each month, to learn about basic app design principles and how to design with the users' needs in mind.

*   Students will come up with an app idea connected to a topic they care about, then discover how to design with inclusion and accessibility as a centerpiece of their app design.

*   Students will be required to prepare a Keynote presentation for submission in SLS. Templates for the Keynote presentation will be provided to schools to guide students to prepare for the submission.

*   Teachers are encouraged to guide their students while leveraging the lesson guides and videos on the SLS.

*   At the end of Phase 1, each participating school will nominate a top idea for a celebration event at Crescent Girls' School showcasing these app ideas.

Kickstart school holidays with Everyone Can Code virtual workshops using activities from Apple’s Quick Start to Code guide.

**Objective:** To equip students with basic coding skills through fun activities using Swift Playgrounds apps. Students will learn how to personalize an app in Swift Playground using the About me playground that celebrates a place or tradition that is important to them.

**Resources provided:** Virtual workshops, videos and supporting content will be shared through SLS.

**Deliverable:** Complete activities in SLS package and a finished About Me app in Swift Playgrounds.

*   During the June holidays, students will spend 5 hours learning basic coding skills with fun activities using Swift Playgrounds. Students would finish the bootcamp with a completed app that celebrates a place or tradition that is important to them.

*   Lesson guides and videos will be made available on SLS for teachers and students to access.

*   After the bootcamp, Crescent Girls’ School will host a graduation event for all participating students.

*   Participating students will be presented e-certificates for completing Phase 1 and Phase 2.

From Phase 1, up to 20 selected teams from Secondary Schools, Junior Colleges and Millennia Institute will bring their proposed app design to life using Swift Playgrounds, over 3 months.

**Objective:** To guide selected students to build their app designs into a fully featured app using Swift Playgrounds.

**Resources provided:** Consultation and guidance from Tinkercademy.

**Deliverable:** Students will demonstrate how their app works during a showcase event.

*   All app ideas from the participating schools in Phase 1 will be reviewed by a selection panel consisting of staff from Tinkercademy and Teacher Coding Champions. Teacher Coding Champions will not be reviewing apps from their own schools.

*   Apps ideas will be selected using a rubric that will be shared during the Coding Champion webinar.

*   Students will present their fully built apps at a celebration event at the end of Phase 3.

#### **Frequently Asked Question (FAQs)**
**1\. How does this program benefit my school?**<br>
Through participation in Swift Explorers Singapore (SES) 2022, we hope that students will develop keen interest in coding and computational thinking skills which will be helpful in the future digital workplace. Further, students will also learn problem solving and collaboration skills which are essential for the future.

**2\. What is the commitment level for the Teacher Coding Champion?**<br>
The Teacher Coding Champion will be the main coordinator for the program for the participating school and will also be the liaison between the participating schools and Crescent Girls’ School. SLS packages will be shared with the Teacher Coding Champion for assignment to participating students. The Teacher Coding Champion is required to set milestone check-ins with participating students and to select the team for the Graduation and Showcase Event for Schools in Term 3 Week 1.

**3\. Is there any registration fee or other cost to participate in the program?**<br>
There is no registration fee for the program. However, schools will need to provide the iPads installed with the Swift Playgrounds app installed if students do not have their own personal device.

**4: Do I need a device to participate in this program?**<br>
Yes. Students will need to have an iPad that is updated to iPadOS 15.2 or later to run the latest version of Swift Playgrounds. A full list of compatible devices can be found below.

| Compatible Devices list |
|---|
| **12.9-inch iPad Pro** (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th Generation)<br>**11-inch iPad Pro** (1st, 2nd and 3rd Generation)<br>**10.5-inch iPad Pro**<br>**9.7-inch iPad Pro**<br>**iPad** (5th, 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th Generation)<br>**iPad mini** (5th and 6th Generation)<br>**iPad mini 4 iPad Air** (3rd and 4th Generation)<br>**iPad Air 2** |
|

**5: How do I tell what is the device I have?**<br>
On your iPad, go into **_Settings > General > About_**. You will be able to see the model name as well as the software version installed in your device.

**6\. What if students do not complete the entire program?**<br>
Students must complete both Phase 1 and Phase 2 in order to be awarded the e-certificate of participation. Selected students will be invited to participate in Phase 3.


**7\. Can I look at the contents before I sign my students up for the program?**<br>
Please refer to the Outline of activities in SLS for Phase 1 and 2 above.<br>
Please contact us at [**ses@crescent.edu.sg**](mailto:ses@crescent.edu.sg) if you need more information.

**8\. Who will be monitoring the progress of students?**<br>
The nominated Teacher Coding Champion will be the main coordinator for participating schools. SLS packages will be shared with the Teacher Coding Champion for assignment to the participating team(s) of students in the school. While the activities are meant for students' self-directed learning (and hence may be positioned as SIL on HBL days), the Teacher Coding Champion should arrange for milestone check-ins with the participating students to ensure that they are on-task and make progress.

**9. How will I know if my students qualify for the e-certificate?**<br>
The Teacher Coding Champion will validate if the students have completed the SLS packages and that the two deliverables in Phase 1 and 2 are of acceptable quality. Selected teams will move to Phase 3 and final apps will be validated for completion. E-certificates will be issued once Crescent Girls’ School receives the confirmed name list from the participating school.
