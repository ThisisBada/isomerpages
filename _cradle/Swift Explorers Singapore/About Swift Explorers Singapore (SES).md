### **About SES**

![](/images/SES2023Logo.png)

Crescent Girls’ School (CGS) is proud to organise Swift Explorers Singapore (SES) 2023!

Join us to discover the wonders of coding!  

SES 2023 is a series of free online coding related activities using resources from Apple, hosted by CGS with training provided by Tinkercademy, an Apple Professional Learning Provider.

Through this programme, students will learn how to design an app connected to a topic they care about. Students will hone computational thinking and creative problem-solving skills through basic coding on the iPad. Coding with Swift is a powerful, intuitive and easy-to-learn programming language which provides students with fun and engaging ways to prepare for the future.

SES 2023 is designed to support Student-Initiated Learning (SIL) for Primary, Secondary, Junior College and Millenia Institute students. Accompanying teachers may also attend similar coding and app development workshops.

In addition, selected participants will have an opportunity to engage with real-world developers, build their app, and showcase their work to industry leaders.

  
  

The programme is free for all public education institutions to participate.
