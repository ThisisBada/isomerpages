### **About SES**

![](/images/ses1.png)

Crescent Girls’ School is organizing the inaugural Swift Explorers Singapore (SES) 2022 using resources from Apple and training supported by Tinkercademy, an Apple Professional Learning Provider. SES 2022 is a series of free coding related activities that allow students from Primary Schools to Junior Colleges to learn app design and Swift coding on the iPad. Tinkercademy is engaged to design the learning journey and provide support to participating schools. This program aims to empower students with critical thinking and creative problem solving skills through basic coding on the iPad. Students will have access to the same opportunities and resources as real-world developers which will help them identify, design, prototype and build apps. Students will also learn essential business skills through pitching their app ideas to a wider audience.
