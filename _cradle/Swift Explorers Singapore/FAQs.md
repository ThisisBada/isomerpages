#### 1. How will SES benefit my school ####

This programme has many hands-on sessions help make coding accessible to students and teachers alike. It mostly utilises the Student Initiated Learning (SIL) hours to foster self-directed learners, develop studentsâ€™ computational thinking and creative problem solving through basic coding on the iPad. It is a perfect opportunity for the students to learn design-thinking principles and other skills high sought for in the digital marketplace.

Participants can also gain e-certificates and CCA points if they have performed well in the SES 2023. Accompanying teachers, Teacher Coding Champions (TCC), can also attain Professional Learning certificates upon completion of SES coding workshops.

#### 2. How will be the content covered? ####

#### 7. What is the role of the Teacher Coding Champion (TCC)? ####
The Teacher Coding Champion (TCC) will be the main coordinator between CGS SES team and the participating school. The lesson materials (e.g. lesson plans and SLS packages) will be shared with the TCC for assignment to participating students. While the activities are design to support Self-Directed Learning, TCCs are required to set milestone check-ins with participating students and to select the team for the SES Showcase and SES Graduation.

During the course of SES 2023, there will be briefing sessions and training workshops for TCCs. Teachers do not need any coding or computing knowledge to be eligible for the role of TCC.
