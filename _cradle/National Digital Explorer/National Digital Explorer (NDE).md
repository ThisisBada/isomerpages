### **National Digital Explorer (NDE)**

<img src="/images/nde1.png" style="width:45%">

Crescent Girls’ School is partnering ICDL Asia, which offers the world’s leading computer skills certification, to organise the inaugural National Digital Explorer (NDE) initiative. NDE is a nationwide digital literacy initiative designed to empower students to learn real-world skills that enable them to think critically and be more productive learners. It is targeted at all upper primary school pupils (Primary 4 to 6) and secondary school students.

To nurture future-ready students for the modern workplace, this initiative will focus on equipping students with key skills and knowledge on the effective use of office productivity tools.

 The NDE learning experience is aligned to the latest Ministry of Education’s EdTech Plan. Students will engage in a range of e-Learning content and activities to build their knowledge progressively. The ICDL e-Learning platform also enables students to learn at their own pace using their personal learning devices. To further enrich their learning experience, students are encouraged to participate in our national and regional competitions to apply what they have learnt and connect with students beyond their community.

_The aims of the programme are as follows:_
a) To develop digitally fluent students equipped with the mastery of practical digital skills for future digital workplace<br>
b) To encourage students to be self-directed learners who take ownership of their learning<br>
c) To nurture students to explore beyond the curriculum and be advocates of digital literacy<br>
d) To provide students with the opportunity to gain an international outlook with ICDL Asia Digital Challenge<br>
e) To inspire schools and teachers to reimagine learning spaces beyond the classroom and design meaningful tech-mediated learning experiences
