### **About the Digital Explorer Learn 2022**
Under Digital Explorer Learn, participating students will undergo the ICDL Application Essentials e-Learning module which will be made available to them from March 2022. The Digital Explorer Learn programme covers the main concepts and skills needed to start using common office productivity applications — Documents, Spreadsheets, and Presentations — effectively. The estimated duration to complete this programme is 8 hours.

The ICDL e-Learning solution provides a slew of interactive content and tools to engage students in their learning experience. After learning the concepts, students will be able to apply and practise their skills using the office applications on their devices. There are also ample hands-on activities, knowledge check exercises and case studies to reinforce students’ understanding through application and testing.

The flexibility of Digital Explorer Learn allows schools to adopt this programme as a self-directed learning activity or complement it for classroom-based teaching. Schools may also choose to implement this programme as a post-exam activity.

At the end of the programme, all students will receive an ICDL certificate of completion through their respective schools. All participating schools should complete Digital Explorer Learn by 15 September 2022.
