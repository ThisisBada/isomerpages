## **Total Defence Day** ##

Organizing the 2023 Total Defence Day concert was exciting, challenging and rewarding all at the same time. The Crez Community Leaders wanted everyone to participate and also ensure that the event was both a positive and enjoyable learning experience. The presentation radiated with Crescentians’ enthusiasm, especially when the emcees announced special prizes to be won for answering questions and it was heartening to see many engaged during the concert. The annual skits resulted in bouts of laughter and earned wide smiles from all who gained new knowledge about the pillar of digital defence. The Secondary 1 to 4 students took part in various activities during the level competition which included filming innovative mannequin challenges and creating creative hand-made murals. With much hard work and coordination put into each submission, many were ecstatic when the results were announced. Hence, at the mention of Gotchas for the level competition winners, everyone awaited in eager anticipation for the news, with applause and cheers reverberating around the hall once the cat was out of the bag.  At the end of the event, the overwhelmingly positive response and the ‘Good Job’ cheer was heartwarming, giving the well deserving Crez Community Leaders a great sense of fulfilment.
