## **Digital and Media Club**

The Digital Art and Manga Club (DAMC) started out as the school’s Art Club, and was transformed in 2006 to become what it is today. Originally a small group where membership numbers were below twenty, it has slowly but surely grown over the years, with numbers hitting 28 in 2013.

Currently, the club’s sessions take place once a week on Mondays at 3-6pm, with optional sessions during the school holidays. Though our main mediums are paper or digital, this does not mean our scope is limited. To date, we have explored a variety of topics, from portrait and scenery painting to making manga playing cards to creating Original Characters.

We also take part in many different competitions, the most recent one being Extravaganza, a nation-wide artwork showcase encompassing of Graphite, a Digital Art Competition, INK!, a Traditional Art Competition, a SEQUENTIAL ARTS competition, the Kaleidoscope illustration exhibition, and the Young Illustrator Award competition. We are please to announce that one of our member, Yanxi, has been shortlisted to be one of the top 6 finalists by judges, who are renowned professional artists, for the Young Illustrator Award, a prestigious award which saw over 3,000 entries from Singapore’s secondary schools.

Our previous achievements include winning the 2nd prize in General's Order, a nation-wide art competition (2010); partnership with the National Environment Agency (NEA) for illustrating the displays at the Alexandra Canal which was officially launched by then Minister Mentor, Mr Lee Kuan Yew (2010); and the Bronze Award at the Singapore Youth Festival Art Competition (2011).

In 2012, our club was given front page and centre spread coverage in Lianhe Zaobao’s Weekly Student Section (ZBComma) in the week of 29 August to 4 September 2012, where the article showcased our members’ skills, works and art-making processes.

We at the DAMC have one very simple philosophy, one that has drawn people with talent in digital or classic hand-drawn pieces to join – that art, be it doodling or drawing cute ‘chibis’, be it with traditional or digital media, is food for the soul. Art brings imagination to life, and as Albert Einstein said, “Imagination is more important than knowledge.” For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination is limitless.
