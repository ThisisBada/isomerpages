## **CRESCENT AMBASSADOR**

>"EVERYONE CAN BE GREAT BECAUSE EVERYONE CAN SERVE"

The Crescent Ambassadors at Crescent Girlsâ€™ School play a significant role in helping to organize commemorative events such as Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day. Crescent Ambassadors try to inject both enriching and educational elements into these events to make it as fun an event as possible for the student body. As the Crescent Ambassador is just establishing, we are looking forward to organizing and executing many more exciting events in the years to come for all Crescentians. We aim to strive towards excellence for all Crescentians.
