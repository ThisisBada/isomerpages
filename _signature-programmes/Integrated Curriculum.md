### **Integrated Curriculum**
#### **About the Curriculum**
At Crescent, we have designed the Integrated Curriculum Programme for Secondary 1, 2 and 3 students. We hope that by the end of Secondary 3, students are able to:
*   Understand the interconnectedness among different subjects and disciplines;
*   Apply knowledge and skills from different subjects to handle authentic performance tasks;
*   Collaborate and co-construct knowledge effectively with their peers at the various stages of the curriculum;
*   Harness Information & communication technology (ICT) effectively to handle their performance tasks;
*   Strengthen their global awareness to be better equipped as citizens of the 21st century.
