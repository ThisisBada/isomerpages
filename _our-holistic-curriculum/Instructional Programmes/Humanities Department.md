### **Humanities Department**
#### **Vision**
To be a department of excellence, which promotes analytical thinking and innovation.

#### **Mission**
To provide a holistic education in **analytical** and **innovative** reasoning so as to develop scholars with **global awareness.**

#### **Curriculum**
By the end of their Crescentian journey, our Humanities scholar will be able to:
*   evaluate data / information critically and independently;
*   apply appropriate research methodologies to investigate geographical, historical and social phenomena;
*   appreciate complex inter-relationship between man and the physical, historical, social and political environment around him;
*   demonstrate an understanding of local and global issues and propose appropriate solutions.

Core to the Humanities disciplines is the engagement of students in DOING Geography, History and the Social Studies.  In doing, students are required to take active ownership of their learning, learning to ask key questions, investigate issues through reading and research and working with peers to seek knowledge.  All these are effectively done under the facilitation of the teachers.

##### **Geographical Investigation**
Geographical Investigation is a form of geographical inquiry where students are required to investigate a geographical issue and demonstrate their learning by completing an end product. In Crescent, our students carry out their GI at the various levels, making sense of the environment in which they live in.

At Secondary One, students undergo GI and explore the issue of water scarcity in Singapore and the world around them under the schools’ signature Integrated Curriculum Programme.  At Secondary Two, students investigate their lived environment in Tiong Bahru through the use of VR.  Upper Secondary students continue to acquire skills in GI through their investigation of the coastal regions as well as tourists spots.   Sec 1 GI – Water Testing   Sec 2 GI –VR at Tiong Bahru Sec 3 GI – Coastal Studies Sec 4 GI - Tourism
