### **Information on Direct School Admission to Crescent Girls' School** ###

We welcome Primary 6 students with talent in the areas of music studies, performing arts, sports and leadership to apply to our school under the Direct School Admission (DSA) Exercise.  Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.

#### **DSA(Sec) Exercise 2023** ####

Talent in the respective areas:
*   MEP (Music Elective Programme)
*   Performing Arts (Concert Band, Choir, Chinese & Modern Dance)
*   Sports (Badminton, Hockey, Netball, Softball, Track & Field and Canoeing)
*   Leadership


Students who are successfully admitted to the school via DSA are expected to honour their commitment to the school and join the respective CCA allocated by the school **throughout their 4 years in Crescent**. Students admitted under DSA (Leadership) are expected to join the school allocated Uniformed Group throughout their 4 years. Students admitted under DSA (MEP) are expected to be in MEP and to join a Music CCA (either Concert Band or Choir) throughout their 4 years.

The selection criteria and process for the talent areas will be updated from early May.  For more information on DSA-Sec, please refer to the MOE website at [https://www.moe.gov.sg/dsa-sec](https://www.moe.gov.sg/dsa-sec).
